PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Imagine an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two
possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are
directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.


CONDITIONS:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by loneliness.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors comes to life.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
1. Store both the files in a same folder.
2. Open any IDE that supports Python language.
3. Run 'UI.py' file from the IDE after opening Files in the IDE.


INPUT AND OUTPUT / Working:
1. After running the file 'UI.py' a Window will pop-up in which it show a grid of 
	random 500 cells which are dead (not one).
2. Use your mouse curser to move around and left click in the cell to mark any cell alive (set to one)
	it will turn black.
3. You can disselect any live cell by clicking on it again if required.
4. Press 'SPACE BAR' on your keyboard to start execution of the program or perform first generation.
5. You can Press 'Space Bar' as many time as you want to execute the generation and the output will be
	on the same window.
6. Use 'R' key on the keyboard to reset all the input given and start again.
7. Window's Close button can be used to close the program.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Make sure you use python language supporting IDE.
2. Make sure you have all the packages like (numpy,pygame) installed  to run this program smoothly.
3. Do not change any code before running the program else may not execute properly.

SCREENSHOT OF THE EXECUTION:
PRESS SPACE BAR TO START.
PRESS R TO RESET.
